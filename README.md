# ioBroker Homebridge accessories manager
=================

Use Homebridge plugins in ioBroker or run a global installed Homebridge as ioBroker adapter.
All States from Homebridge will be available in ioBroker too and can also be controlled there.

## Description
This adapter provides two different modes:

### Default (Wrapper) Mode
In the default mode the adapter allows you to use homebridge Plugin Modules directly.
You can explore all available plugins at the NPM website by [searching for the keyword `homebridge-plugin`](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=homebridge-plugin).

You simply add the list of modules to the Adapter configuration and provide the configuration
in the JSON-editor (see Plugin descriptions).
After this all Homebridge objects will be created in ioBroker too and all writable objects can
be changed too.

### Global-Homebridge-Mode
If you already use Homebridge (Apple OpenSource SmartHome) to control your devices
then you can use this existing Homebridge installation and start this Homebridge
installation as ioBroker process. In this case the Homebridge server is started by ioBroker.
Additionally all states from Homebridge are available as states in ioBroker and allows to
control from ioBroker.

For this to work you need to provide the location of the systems global node-modules folder. For this call **npm root -g**. Additionally you need to privide the path of the homebridge configuration directory (usually .homebridge in the users folder).
